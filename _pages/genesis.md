This was my team's submission for the [2016 Ubisoft Game Lab competition](https://montreal.ubisoft.com/en/ubisoft-game-lab-competition-2016/), where university level contestants 
are placed into groups of 8 developers and challenged to create a video game prototype within 10 weeks. This year's theme was "Ocean", and the technical mandate included requiremets 
like the game be executed in 3D, have at least two game systems that interact with each other, present three game mechanics that may interact with the systems, among others.

Genesis is an exploration game where the player (Damu) must revitalize a barren ocean bed by controlling the vegetation around him and directing it towards a "regeneration flower" objective, 
while fending off AI fauna that wants to consume any vegetation in sight.

The player can control the elements, allowing them to terraform the terrain to reach other areas, as well as fend off the animals that try to consume the limited and much needed vegetation. 
They can also wanipulate the wind to perform a basic attack.

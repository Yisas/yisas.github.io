### Summary

Limb Wars is a 2D video game prototype produced for the Introduction to Game Development course offered at Concordia University, by a team of 4 programmers. A 2-player PVP 
video game prototype inspired by Nidhogg, except ypur own limbs serve simultaneously as both your weapons and health points. Get hit once, lose an arm. Get hit a second time, 
now you lost a leg. Wanna hit your enemy with something other than your punny fists? Use an arm, just be careful because you only have two of them.

I worked on a few aspects of this game but my main contributions were the animations and the original concept. I still might pick it up again and go for a more polished version. 
One of my favorite parts about making this prototype was a pivot in how the aesthetic was interpreted. It was originally envisioned as much more gruesome and serious than what it ended 
up as, but once the animations were in, we sped them up until we reached the most entretaining outcome gameplay-wise. The sped up animations now looked quite comical, and so the 
soundtrack and the rest of the assets were edited to reflect that. It still had a horror motif, but it felt more fitting to make it campy, Goosebumps style.

I don't have that much to say about this one, it was a straightforward assignment where the design was already layed out. The one thing this game taught me is that

But even more importantly, [here's the soundtrack](https://youtu.be/e9I_7eJxtZc) in case you like it half as much as I do. I'm off to rewatch some Stranger Things.

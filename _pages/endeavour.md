Endeavour is a 2D video game prototype produced for the Introduction to Game Development course offered at Concordia University. The assignment was designed as small 
scale implementation of a Star Force clone, with a few added features. It also needed to include "bullet hell" mode where bullets wraped around the screen, and we were 
asked to make our own boss fight.

I do not own, buy or create any of the art or sound assets featured in this prototype. They were found in open source asset websites, with some being slightly modified 
for this project's purposes. Implementation wise it was a straightforward assignment where most of the design was already layed out. The one thing this game taught me 
is that it doesn't really feel like a video game [until you add screenshake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJdEqssNZ-U). That's an important lesson in my book. Here's 
a gameplay video if you're interested.

But even more importantly, [here's the soundtrack](https://youtu.be/e9I_7eJxtZc) in case you like it half as much as I do. I'm off to rewatch some Stranger Things.

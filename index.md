# Introduction

This project was developed for the "COMP477 - Animation for Computer Games" course at Concordia University.
It is a simulation of the Magnus Effect, which is the force exerted on rapidly spinning spheres moving through air.
This physical phenomenon is most recognizable in common culture when observing the curved paths that skilled players
can apply to golf, soccer and baseballs. This project intends to bring a visualization of the Magnus force, and allow
the users to tweak the parameters of the simulation, in order to further undestand the conditions that affect this phenomena.
We have also aimed to provide a comparative evaluation between the common theoretical equations used to describe this
force and a real life example, by recording the magnus effect in action and comparing the results to the simulation.

# How does the Magnus Effect work?

When a ball is spinning within a fluid, most commonly air, one side of the ball drags the fluid in the direction of
its rotation, while the other side of the ball is pushed by the air being dragged towards it. This result in a
sideways force that is proportinal to the angular and linear velocity of the ball, given that its cause is an angular
deflection of air flow. The following video provides an improved visualization of the above:

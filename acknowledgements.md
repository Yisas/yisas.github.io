The following resources were used for the development of this project:

# [Glitter](https://github.com/Polytonic/Glitter) 

A simple boilerplate for OpenGL that compiles and statically links every required library, listed below.
Note that the [bullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) physics library which ships as part of the bundle is taken out of this 
project, as the goal was to implement the physics simulation from scratch.

* [assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp): a mesh loading library
* [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad): an OpenGL function loader library
* [glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw): a windowing and input library
* [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm): an OpenGL mathematics library
* [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb): a texture loading library

# [NanoGUI](https://github.com/wjakob/nanogui)
A minimalistic cross-platform GUI library for OpenGL.

# [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com)
An educational website for OpenGL from which some code is borrowed, namely for shaders and model loading.

#[Tracker](https://physlets.org/tracker/)
A free video analysis and modeling tool that was used to track the ping pong ball in the experimantal recordings of the Magnus Effect.
